                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Swami Vivekananda, born Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu monk and a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. He is best known for his speech which began with the words - "Sisters and brothers of America ..." at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.

                    Vivekananda was born into an aristocratic Bengali family in Calcutta and was inclined towards spirituality. He was a disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. Later, he travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions.
